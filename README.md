## Hi, I'm Thomas / parsehex ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught web developer who's been programming since learning PHP back in 2010. Here's a bit of what I'm up to:

- I've begun reviving old projects, starting with the pointless blog [Daily False Facts](https://dailyfalsefacts.com).
- A [forkable app](https://github.com/ProjectDepot/Gallery) to generate an automatic portfolio from your GitHub profile -- [you might be on it right now](https://parsehex.github.io/).
- I both **love** and **hate** AI, so I'm trying to use it in unique ways, or at least that's the goal. I have an [AI companion app](https://github.com/parsehex/buddyGenAI) and I'm experimenting with [making procedural sprites using language models](https://github.com/parsehex/aAI-Art).
