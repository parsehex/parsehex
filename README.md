## Hi, I'm Thomas / parsehex ðŸ‘‹ (work in progress)

I'm a self-taught full stack web developer who's been programming since learning PHP in high school back in 2010.

### Tech Stack / Interests

- **Web**: TypeScript, Vue.js, TailwindCSS
- Electron
- Python
- AI/ML with software like [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp), [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp), [stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp)

### Iâ€™m working on

#### [Project Depot Gallery](https://github.com/ProjectDepot/Gallery)

An app that you can fork to get an easy auto-generated list of your repositories.

This project is used for my own root github.io site at <https://parsehex.github.io/>

#### [buddyGenAI](https://github.com/parsehex/BuddyGenAI) (prototype)

This is an AI chat app designed for lonely people to get social interaction. You can create and chat with AI buddies, give them a description and you can generate a profile picture for them which appears in-chat.

#### [aAI Art](https://github.com/parsehex/sprite-generator) ([view](https://parsehex.github.io/aAI-Art/))

An experiment to use LLMs to generate sprite graphics.

#### [TaskMate](https://github.com/parsehex/TaskMate)

This is a desktop app that I made as a way to better understand programming with LLMs. In the app, you manage a list of prompt Snippets and select Snippets & Files (in the project you're working on) to include in the prompt.
